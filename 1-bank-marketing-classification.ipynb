After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients.\n\n## About Dataset \nIt is a dataset that describing Portugal bank marketing campaigns results.Conducted campaigns were based mostly on direct phone calls, offering bank client to place a term deposit.
